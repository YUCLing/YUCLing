### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile! Now let me introduce myself to you. ðŸ˜ƒ

## Who Am I

I'm a senior high school student living in Guangxi, China. Programming is one of my hobbies, that's why I'm here!

I like to help others with no condition. I guess you've learned that from some of my contributions or projects already ðŸ¤”. However, if you want some help from me, you can reach out directly! I will help you as much as I can ðŸ˜Š.

## What Am I Doing Now

Currently, I'm working on a [player](https://github.com/M4TEC/PenguinPlayer). It's a modular web music player, which aims to create a better embedding webpage music player experience. You can help me with it too. If you do so, I will be very appreciated! ðŸ¤—

Also, I'm working on a rhythm game too. It's not published and is in the early stage of development. ðŸ‘€

## What Am I Learning

Even though I got so many things to do, I'm still trying to find some time to learn C and C++. If you wonder why I'm studying it, it's because that C/C++ is a low-level language. So I can do many things with them if I know how to use them. âœ…

## How To Reach Me

The best way to reach me is using email, and... I think it's on my profile, right? You must have seen it already, haven't you? ðŸ™„


At last, wish you a happy life!

<!--# About Giving Up GitHub
Note: I encourage you to add the below to your existing `README.md` on your GitHub project.

== I'm Still Using GitHub Under Protest ==

Most of my projects are currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub
is a proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  I'm deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub to
develop our FOSS project. I urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org)
campaign from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to
understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS
projects.

Any use of my projects' code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without my permission.  I do not consent to GitHub's use of my projects'
code in Copilot.
