### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile! Now let me introduce myself to you. ðŸ˜ƒ

## Who Am I

I'm a senior high school student living in Guangxi, China. Programming is one of my hobbies, that's why I'm here!

## What Am I Doing Now

Currently, I'm working on a [player](https://github.com/M4TEC/PenguinPlayer). It's a modular web music player, which aims to create a better embedding webpage music player experience. You can help me with it too. If you do so, I will be very appreciated! ðŸ¤—

At last, wish you a happy life!
